# app_playground

A new Flutter project. This is an app built for to purpose of being a testing ground for things I'd like to learn. Currently it takes the form of a POS ordering system, like a server or bartender might use to enter in orders for a table via their mobile device.

- Firebase Auth handles signup/login/user information.
- Firestore provides the database for storing menu items, and order information.

Grid view menu items are generated by a menu class that matches lists of submenus with the menu selected on the main page (drinks => cocktails or beer, etc). Each submenu then generates a list of items pulled from the database according to the name of the submenu.

# Overview

Currently this is a basic signup/login app using Firebase Auth.
